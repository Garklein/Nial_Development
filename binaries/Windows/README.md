# Windows 10 Binaries

This folder contains two versions of Nial as ZIP files 

1. **Win64Basic** - a version of Nial which does not need external libraries
2. **Win64All** - a version of Nial which uses the CSFML libraries and the FFTW3 libraries. The DLLs for these libraries are contained in the dll subfolder. This folder also contains a DLL for OpenAL32 if you don't already have that on your machine.

The Win64All version be can be used with the sound library created by Stuart Smith.
